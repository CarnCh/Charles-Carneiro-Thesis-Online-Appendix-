# Charles-Carneiro-Thesis-Online-Appendix-
This repository contains the code and data used for the thesis: “Securitised Safe Assets in the Euro Area: A Monte Carlo Analysis of European Sovereign Bonds” by Charles Carneiro, University of St. Gallen (HSG), November 2025.

The appendix provides complete transparency of the modelling pipeline, including:
Data preprocessing and weighting logic,
Simulation code for baseline, contagion, and stress scenarios,

The simulations extend Brunnermeier et al. (2017)’s ESBies model using recent data (2010–2024) and introduce t-copula dependence, contagion dynamics, and systemic stress calibration.
